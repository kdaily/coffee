Coffee site powered by Django
================================

Need to describe the directory structure here (use Two Scoops as reference).

Requirements
------------
* virtualenv
* Django 1.5
* mysql-python
* sorl_thumbnail
* PIL
* django-ratings: https://github.com/dcramer/django-ratings

All requirements files are in the "requirements" sub-directory. To install all requirements, make a new virtual environment, and then:

```
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```
